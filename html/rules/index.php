<h4>Abuse or Exploit of a Bug or Glitch</h4>

<p>Exploiting any bug, whether Minecraft related (F3 + A) or plugin related, for the use of personal gain or causing harm to the server or its players is bannable. Maliciously using the factions plugin in ways that it is not meant for is considered abusing, this means things like storage factions and kicking to avoid power loss are not allowed. If you aren't sure if something is allowed, ask before you do it to prevent a possible ban. If you find a bug, please report it immediately to the admins through either private message or the <a href="http://kohi.net/support">ticket system</a>.</p>

</ul>

<p>This has become a big problem recently and it is not acceptable.</p>

<ul>
<li>Punishment decided by Admin</li>
</ul>

<p>Racism will not be tolerated, harassment of our players and staff will not be tolerated, and spamming will not be tolerated. Scamming i.e. promising any purchasable items (CS: GO items, server ranks etc.) in exchange for in game items (diamonds and whatever else it is you guys are too lazy to actually play the game and get) or to join a faction, with the intent of not following through is NOT allowed in chat. If you are seen doing this in chat you will be muted, how long you are muted is up to the admins. Use common sense when typing in chat. If it isn't something you'd say to someone's face, then it isn't something you should say here. Releasing personal information about players includes but is not limited to facebook/instagram accounts, phone number, skype names, addresses, or pictures. This will result in a temp/permban or a blacklist depending on the situation. To what extent the offender went to obtain the information is also a factor, if you they got your picture from a faction irl video don't expect us ban them for "doxing".</p>
